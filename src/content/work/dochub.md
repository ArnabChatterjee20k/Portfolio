# DocHub.ai
We as a college students need to write a lot of assignments. So I did a suvery in our college where the most of the time passes by. Most of the responses were based on time, hopping from sites to sites, collaboration, and publishing so that we can share.
So I built DocHub solving all these issues.

## Why this tech stack?
MongoDb is used as database as we are storing objects in the database forauto saving feature and sharing functionality. MongoDb is great for storing objects type.
React Js is used so that user does not get bored seeing web page loading. It is a single page application.
Node Js with Express js as it makes defining our api quickly without alot of boilerplate.
